                        aK AUBERGE is a hotel search and offers users information about different types of accommodation
                        (such as hotels, holiday homes, etc.), travel areas and services associated with travel.<br>

                        1. Scope of Service<br>
                        1.1. These terms and conditions are subject to occasional changes and apply to all our services
                        that are directly or indirectly provided (i.e. via third parties) via the internet, on mobile
                        devices, by email or by telephone.<br>
                        1.2. By using our website, you confirm that you have read, understood and agree to these terms
                        and conditions, as well as the privacy policy, including the use of cookies.<br>
                        2. Services and Contract<br>
                        2.1. On the aK AUBERGE website, you have the ability to compare third party services via the
                        trivago system.<br>
                        2.2. In addition, for some hotels, users have the possibility of booking the selected hotel
                        through a direct connection to the hotel booking sites (third parties) (‘aK AUBERGE Booking’).
                        As a result, the booking will be made directly on the hotel booking site and not on the aK
                        AUBERGE sites. In such cases, aK AUBERGE is not the travel operator or the contractual party for
                        the user, but only an agent providing the technical connection to the hotel booking site of a
                        third party. By making a booking on the website of the third party, users agree to be bound by
                        the terms and conditions of that booking site. These terms and conditions can be viewed on the
                        website of the third party. Once a booking is made on the website of a third party, a contract
                        is concluded between the booking site and the user, and therefore no contract is concluded
                        between the user and aK AUBERGE. aK AUBERGE is no contractual party to the hotel booking and all
                        and any claims of the user under the hotel reservation are to be asserted against the third
                        party (the booking site) and not against aK AUBERGE.<br>
                        2.3. This agreement is not affected by any other agreements between the hotel and users.<br>
                        3. Privacy, Email Advertisments<br>
                        3.1. The protection of personal data provided by the user is of the highest priority for
                        trivago. As such, aK AUBERGE makes every effort to ensure compliance with data protection. For
                        more information, please read our privacy policy.<br>
                        3.2. aK AUBERGE collects, processes and uses your personal data (hereafter “data”) only if we
                        have obtained your consent or a statutory provision allows for the collection, processing or use
                        of your data.<br>
                        3.3. aKAUBERGE will only raise, process and use data necessary for the provision of the services
                        rendered by aK AUBERGE, for the use and operation of the websites / apps and the services
                        offered. For the use of the ‘aK AUBERGE Booking’ facility, the user expressly agrees to the
                        processing of his/her credit card data by aK AUBERGE, which may relay these to the hotel booking
                        sites for completing the hotel reservation.<br>
                        4. User Obligation<br>
                        4.1. The user is responsible for the acquisition of rights to the content (text, photos,
                        reviews, links, etc.) they upload to aK AUBERGE. They ensure that they have all the rights in
                        respect to the content they publish on the aK AUBERGE platform and thereby do not violate the
                        rights of any third parties.<br>
                        4.2. The user guarantees not to use programmes or functions to generate automated page
                        impressions or content on aK AUBERGE.<br>
                        4.3. If there is a breach in the terms and conditions, aK AUBERGE reserves the right to remove
                        content without declaration of reason, to withhold payments earned in the aK AUBERGE Community
                        and to permanently ban members from aK AUBERGE. The right to prosecution of criminal acts
                        remains unaffected.<br>
                        5. Liability<br>
                        5.1. aK AUBERGE is not liable for the accuracy, quality, completeness, reliability or
                        credibility of content provided by users and/or booking sites. In particular, there is no advice
                        or information from aK AUBERGE regarding the selection of accommodations.<br>
                        5.2. aK AUBERGE is not liable for technical malfunctions for which the cause is not within aK
                        AUBERGE's sphere of responsibility or for damages caused by force majeure. aK AUBERGE does not
                        guarantee uninterrupted availability of data and may perform technical maintenance during a
                        freely chosen time period.<br>
                        6. Applicable Laws and Place of Jurisdiction<br>
                        The laws of the Republic of India apply. For business persons or individuals that do not have
                        general jurisdiction in Delhi, India applies as the place of jurisdiction. Otherwise the legal
                        jurisdiction applies.
