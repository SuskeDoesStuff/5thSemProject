                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>It is very easy. At first type (enter) the name of your destination/hotel, including the date
                            of your stay, into the blue "Search box". Then just click on the red button "Search".
                            Immediately, all the available rooms will show up, including prices for the whole stay
                            (number of nights you filled previously). You can also use our filters for a more specific
                            accommodation request, such as price per room, star rating, hotel type, facilities, etc. On
                            the top of the page, you can also sort the accommodation based on popularity, price per
                            room, guest rating, and distance from the center. You can also select a suitable
                            accommodation on the map located on our home page – all hotels are listed there together
                            with all the main attractions. This is quite helpful if you do not know the destination much

                        <p>aK AUBERGE.com acts as an intermediary between our clients and hotels. Your credit card
                            details are required by hotels in most cases as a guarantee for your reservation in case of
                            late cancellation or “no-show”. The hotels have the right to preauthorize your credit card,
                            so please make sure that your credit card is valid. Also, please note, that if you book a
                            Non-refundable room, this type of room has special conditions and your credit card will be
                            charged in advance. Please, always double-check the payment and cancellation policy of the
                            room you are interested in before you proceed with the reservation.</p>

                            so please refer to the room conditions of each room.</p>
